# Datathon_IndoML_2022
Predicting Document Class from images using ML
#
#### This code was developed as a part of a kaggle competition, Datathon, held in conjunction with IndoML 2022 <br>
Given a set of grayscale document images, the task was to classify each image into one of the 16 classes or document types. 
The training dataset consists of 16000 images with 1000 images belonging to each class. The dataset was collected from the RVL-CDIP dataset.
